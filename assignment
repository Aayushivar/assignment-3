ASSIGNMENT-3
WHAT IS r+,w+,a+
CREATE A CALCULATOR WHERE THE VALUES AND OPERATERS NEED TO BE GIVEN BY THE USER AND STORE THE VALUES IN THE FILE:-

r+: Read mode
The r+ means reading the file .
The read mode in python opens an exciting file for reading, positioning the pointer at the file's start it only allow to read the file which we have created.


w: Write mode
w+ means write and read the file.
It opens a file for both writing and reading .
If file exists,write truncates (clears) any existing information .

a+: Append mode
It adds ingormation to an existing file,placing the pointer at the end,if a file does not exist, append mode creates the file.

myfile=open("myself.txt","r")
print(myfile.read())
this a new assignment 

myfile=open("myself.txt","w")
myfile.write("I m a student\n")
14

myfile=open("myself.txt","r")
print(myfile.read())
I m a student

myfile=open("myself.txt","a")
myfile.write("I like python")
13

myfile=open("myself.txt","r")
print(myfile.read())
I m a student
I like python

with open("myself.txt","w+") as file:
    file.write("this a new assignment \n")
myfile=open("myself.txt","r")
print(myfile.read())
this a new assignment
